goIPbus
=======

A purely Go implentation of the client (computer) side of the IPbus protocol for communicating with FPGAs over the network.

This package was originally developed as part of the SoLid experiment for a 288 kg reactor neutrino experiment.
It has since been converted into its own package and undergone a fairly major API update.
It is currently in private alpha development for a 1600 kg reactor neutrino detector.
An public beta release is planned for late 2016/early 2017.
